# --description--

In conversations, especially when learning new concepts, it's useful to repeat or rephrase what you've heard to confirm understanding. This strategy helps clarify and reinforce learning. For instance, in programming, discussing concepts like error handling and conditional statements can be complex, and repeating these concepts in your own words can ensure you've understood them correctly.
